Special Instructions for Using Form and / or Login
---
- The main feature is the **chat form**, which allows users to send messages and receive responses from the Gemini API.
- The app also requires user registration and login to access certain features, such as the chat functionality.
- Ensure that MongoDB Atlas is connected and that the backend is running on the correct port (31940) on Courant's server.
- If you encounter issues with logging in or registering users, check that both frontend and backend are running correctly using PM2.
